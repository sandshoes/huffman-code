# huffman-code

Project on Huffman Coding

Huffman coding was one of the first compression algorithms. In this project I have decided to compress the famous Spanish novel called 'El Quijote' by Miguel de Cervantes. The script dict_comp.py will compress the file from 2.1 MB to 1.2MB. Then executing the dict_decomp.py will decompress the information and write it in a file called decompressed.txt that will be an exact replica of quijote.txt.
