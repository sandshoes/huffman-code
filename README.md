# huffman-code
University project on Huffman Coding

In the Fall 2018 course Classical and Quantum Information Theory at the University of Barcelona we have had to make 
a Huffman encoder and decoder.The goal of the project was to compress the famous Spanish tale of El Quijote from a 
2.1MB text file to a 1.2MB one. Then using the decompressor the code has to return the compressed file to its 
original version.
